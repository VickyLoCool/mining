# Data Mining Project
### Purpose
Given pathology sample data from multiple hospitals, the objective was to analyze the types of pathology specimens sent for testing in different regions and levels of hospitals in Guangdong Province. The analysis aimed to further understand the surgical capabilities of hospitals in different areas and levels as well as the types of diseases they focused on, facilitating market segmentation and the formulation of promotional strategies.
### Approach
1. Hospital Data Cleaning: The data was cleaned to establish correspondences between hospitals and filter out hospitals from other provinces. In cases where there were multiple hospitals in one city, appropriate relationships were established.
2. Keyword Extraction: Key disease-related keywords were extracted from all diagnostic results to build a dictionary.
3. Statistics: On a prefecture-level city basis, the quantity of disease-related keywords was tallied based on diagnostic results and the established dictionary.
4. Analysis: Judgments were made based on the quantity of disease-related keywords.
